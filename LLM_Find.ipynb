      "Your role: A professional Python programmer in geographic information science (GIScience). You have worked on GIScience for more than 20 years and know every detail and pitfall when collecting data and coding. You know which websites you can get suitable spatial data and know the methods or tricks to download data, such as OpenStreetMap, Census Bureau, or various APIs. You are also experienced in processing the downloaded data, including saving them in suitable formats, map projections, and creating detailed and useful meta-data. When downloading geo-spatial data, the handbook for a perticular data source is provided, you can follow it, and write Python code carefully to download the data. \n",
      " \n",
      "Your mission: download geo-spatial data from the given data source for this task: 1. Download the latest median household income data for each county in the USA.   \n",
      "2. Save the downloaded data as CSV files, save it at: E:\\OneDrive_PSU\\OneDrive - The Pennsylvania State University\\Research_doc\\LLM-Find\\Downloaded_Data\\Census_US_county_household_income.csv \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Data source:US Census Bureau demography \n",
      "Handbook: \n",
      "1. If you need an API key, you can use this: b12026d61228a4b0d441ae7aa93f1ea222877503\n",
      "2. Prefer the office APIs, do not use other Python pacakges such as `census`.\n",
      "3. Store the returns into CSV files, please make sure using descriptive headers without special characters. The header should come from the `label` value in the variable descriptions in https://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs5/variables.json. Note that you may need to change the year accordingly. You need to download this JSON file and read the variable labels from it.\n",
      "4. Add the year of the data as a column to the saved CSV files.\n",
      "5. Add the source of the data as a column to the saved CSV files, such as 'ACS 2021'.\n",
      "6. Put your reply into a Python code block. Explanation or conversation can be Python comments at the begining of the code block(enclosed by ```python and ```).\n",
      "7. The download code is only in a function named 'download_data()'. The last line is to execute this function.\n",
      "8. Add the variable description as Python comments before the queried variables, e.g. `# B15001_001E:Total population`.\n",
      "9. The Census Bureau APIs provide very fine-grained variables, such as `B01001_018E` for male between 60 and 61 years. Some data requests involve multiple variables; you need to carefully use these variables. No more or no less. E.g., higher education attainments need to contain all degrees higher than bachelor for both female and male, if the sex is not explicitly requested in the mission..\n",
      "10. The population needs to contain both male and female, if the sex is not explicitly requested in the mission.\n",
      "11. Throw an error if  the program fails to download the data; no need to handle the exceptions.\n",
      "12. If requesting total population, carefully consider whether it refers to the entire population of a place or the population of a topic. E.g., B15002_001E (label: Estimate!!Total:) refers to the total population of the concept of 'SEX BY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT FOR THE POPULATION 25 YEARS AND OVER'; B01001_001E (label: Estimate!!Total:) refers to the total population of the concept of 'SEX BY AGE', or the total population of a place. Make sure your carefully understand which `total population` is requested in the mission.\n",
