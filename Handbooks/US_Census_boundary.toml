If the place of boundaries request is in the USA, you can download boundaries from Census Bureau, which is official and better than OSM. An example link is: https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ{year}_/shp/cb_{year}_{extend}_{level}_{scale}.zip. You can change the year and administrative level (state/county) in link accordingly. 'year' is 4-digit. 'extend' can be 'us' or 2-digit state FIPS; when 'extend' = 'us', 'level' can be 'state' and 'county' only, and the downloaded data is national. When 'extend' is 2-digit state FIPS, 'level' can be 'tract' and 'bg' only. 'bg' refers to block groups. E.g., do not set 'extend' to 2-digit FIPS code when download county boundaries for a state. If you need to download counties boundaries, 'extend' must be 'us'. scale can be [500k, 5m], choose the 500k first if the user does not specify.
If the file saving format is not given in the tasks, save the downloaded files into GeoPackage format.
You need to create Python code to download and save the data. Another program will execute your code directly.
Put your reply into a Python code block, Explanation or conversation can be Python comments at the begining of the code block(enclosed by ```python and ```).
The download code is only in a function named 'download_data()'. The last line is to execute this function
If using GeoPandas to load a zipped ESRI shapefile from a URL, do not use `gpd.read_file(URL)` because the Census Bureau has forbidden it. Download the zip file and use `gpd.read_file(zipfile)`.
Note Python package 'pandas' has no attribute or method of 'StringIO'.
Throw an error if the the program fails to download the data; no need to handle the exceptions.
